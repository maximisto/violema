/**
 * The credit cliff, both halves.
 *
 * A tenant ran a mission with 105 credits available against a 200-credit plan.
 * The run did all its expensive work and only then threw at `settleCreditHold`,
 * and the resulting failure path replaced the run's artifacts with a bare error
 * note. Two separate defects: nothing asked whether the run was affordable
 * before spending, and the settlement treated an overrun as fatal.
 *
 * ── Why this file chdirs before it imports anything ──────────────────────────
 *
 * `src/platform/store.ts` resolves its data files at MODULE LOAD time:
 *
 *     const LEDGER_FILE = path.join(process.cwd(), 'platform-credit-ledger.json');
 *
 * So the very first import of the store — including a transitive one through
 * `creditPreflight` — permanently binds these tests to whatever the cwd was at
 * that moment. Importing before `process.chdir` therefore does not merely leak
 * between tests; it writes synthetic ledger entries into the REAL
 * `backend/platform-credit-ledger.json`, which holds live customer credit
 * records.
 *
 * Hence: one temp directory, entered before the first import, and every test
 * scoped by a unique workspace id rather than by a fresh directory. The
 * `assertSandboxed` guard below fails loudly if that invariant is ever broken
 * by a future edit.
