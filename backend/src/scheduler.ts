/**
 * Apply a newer seed version to an automation the operator already has.
 *
 * Seed propagation used to be `{ ...stored, ...seed }` with a handful of
 * exceptions. That reversed the ownership question: every field defaulted to
 * seed-owned, and any operator edit the exception list did not happen to
 * mention was silently reverted at the next deploy. The v3→4 bump reverted an
 * operator-chosen schedule and delivery channel in production that way.
 *
 * So ownership is now explicit and total. Every field of `AutomationRecord`
 * belongs to exactly one side:
 *
 * SEED-OWNED — what the automation DOES. Violema maintains these, and a
 * version bump is how improvements reach existing installs:
 *   version, workflowId, name, description, authoring_mode, workflow_prompt,
 *   actions, steps, execution_policy
 *
 * OPERATOR-OWNED — when it runs, where it delivers, and whose it is. Never
 * overwritten by a seed, because the console is the authority on these and a
 * silent revert is indistinguishable from a bug:
 *   status, schedule, cron_expression, timezone, notify, condition,
 *   workspaceId, owner_user_id, studio_state, created_at, and the run history
 *   (last_run_at, last_run_status, consecutive_failures, next_run_at)
 *
 * Consequence worth stating plainly: a seed can no longer change the cadence or
 * delivery target of an automation someone already has. That is deliberate — if
 * a future seed must move an existing install's schedule, do it as an explicit
 * migration, not as a side effect of shipping new steps.
