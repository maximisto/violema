/**
 * Run-time readiness enforcement.
 *
 * Readiness used to be advisory: the dashboard could show "connect Stripe"
 * while the scheduler happily ran the automation anyway, burned credits, and
 * produced a brief built on nothing. This module is the gate that turns that
 * advice into an enforced precondition, evaluated before a run reserves any
 * credits or calls any model.
 *
 * Enforcement is deliberately TIERED, because the readiness table only knows
 * two workflows:
 *
 *   1. Demo workspaces      → bypassed entirely. Demo surfaces are allowed to
 *                             show labeled sample data, so gating them would
 *                             break the product tour.
 *   2. Supported workflows  → the full `checkWorkflowReadiness` report.
 *   3. Everything else      → per-step source readiness derived from the
 *                             automation's own query steps. Applying the
 *                             two-workflow table here would mark every custom
 *                             automation permanently unready and brick them.
 *
 * Tier 3 is not stricter than the data layer already is: `executeQueryData`
 * fails closed for a non-demo workspace on any source outside the live-capable
 * set. The gate simply reaches that verdict before the money is spent, and
 * names the connection to fix.
