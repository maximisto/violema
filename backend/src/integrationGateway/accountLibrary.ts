/**
 * Account memory — the intelligence library.
 *
 * A mission that researches the same question every week and starts from a
 * blank page every week is a search box on a timer. The library is what turns
 * repetition into compounding: each run READS what Violema already knows about
 * this account, reasons about the delta, and WRITES back what it learned.
 *
 * THE DAY-ONE ONBOARDING STORY
 *
 *   1. The customer connects Google Drive (one OAuth, on /integrations).
 *   2. Their first mission run reads the library, finds it empty, and says so
 *      honestly — no prior findings, so this run is the baseline.
 *   3. That run appends its findings, creating `Violema Library/<Section>/` in
 *      the customer's own Drive.
 *   4. Every run after that opens with real prior context: "here is what we
 *      knew, here is what changed." By week four the mission is reasoning
 *      about a trend line no fresh web search could reconstruct.
 *
 * WHY THE CUSTOMER'S DRIVE, NOT OUR DATABASE
 *
 * The library is the customer's own institutional memory, so it lives in
 * storage they own, can read without us, can audit, and can take with them if
 * they leave. That is a deliberate trust position, not a storage shortcut. It
 * also means the folder is a product surface: a founder can open
 * `Violema Library/Competitive Intelligence/` and read the whole history as
 * plain markdown files, with no Violema login.
 *
 * WHY NO CACHED FOLDER ID
 *
 * The obvious optimization is to cache the folder id in workspace settings.
 * This module deliberately does not, and resolves the folder against Drive on
 * every call instead. Drive is the system of record here — the customer can
 * rename, move, or delete the folder at any time, and a cached id that has
 * quietly gone stale is the single most dangerous state this module could
 * hold, because the operation it feeds is a WRITE. Resolution costs one extra
 * find per call on a weekly mission, which is not a price worth paying a
 * correctness risk to avoid. If that ever shows up in latency, the right fix
 * is a short-lived in-process memo (the `readConnectedAppsWithCache` pattern
 * in composioBridge), not durable persistence of another system's id.
 *
 * MISSION-AGNOSTIC BY CONSTRUCTION
 *
 * Nothing here knows what a competitor is. A "section" is just a named
 * subfolder, so any mission — weekly founder update, customer health, hiring
 * pipeline — adopts the library by naming a section in its step inputs. No new
 * code is required to add one.
 *
 * NOTION / STRUCTURED BACKENDS — deliberately not built
 *
 * Notion is a credible second backend behind this same interface: sections map
 * to databases and entries to pages, which would buy queryable structure that
 * flat markdown files do not have. It is not built because Drive is the
 * connected surface today and a second backend before the first one has users
 * is speculative. Note also what is explicitly OUT of scope: coupling this to
 * any personal knowledge vault. The library is customer-owned storage for a
 * customer's own account memory — it must never read from, write to, or depend
 * on an operator's private notes.
 *
 * TRUST FLOOR
 *
 * - Fails closed. Drive not connected means an honest blocker naming Google
 *   Drive, never a silently skipped step and never invented library content.
 * - Reads never write. `readLibrary` only ever looks; the folder is created by
 *   `appendLibraryEntry`, which is already an audited external action. A read
 *   step must not mutate the customer's Drive as a side effect.
 * - Writes stay inside the library. Every create is parented to a folder id
 *   this module resolved under `Violema Library`; a write is refused outright
 *   rather than falling back to the Drive root.
 * - Bounded. Reads cap entry count, per-entry bytes, and total bytes, so a
 *   large library can never flood a model prompt or this process's memory.
 *
 * VERIFIED COMPOSIO ACTIONS (checked against the live tool registry, not docs —
 * all present and non-deprecated on toolkit `googledrive`):
 *
 *   GOOGLEDRIVE_FIND_FILE           q, fields, orderBy, pageSize, spaces
 *                                   -> { files: [{ id, name, ... }] }
 *   GOOGLEDRIVE_CREATE_FOLDER       name (required), parent_id
 *                                   -> { id }
 *   GOOGLEDRIVE_CREATE_FILE_FROM_TEXT
 *                                   file_name + text_content (required),
 *                                   mime_type, parent_id  -> { id, name }
 *   GOOGLEDRIVE_DOWNLOAD_FILE       fileId (required), mime_type
 *                                   -> { downloaded_file_content: { s3url } }
 *
 * Note `GOOGLEDRIVE_DOWNLOAD_FILE` does NOT return file text inline — it
 * returns a presigned S3 URL that must be fetched separately. That is why this
 * module carries a bounded `fetchText` dependency at all.
