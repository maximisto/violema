// Folder-drop settings contract.
//
// Task 8 of the library folder-drop ingestion feature: the Settings page
// needs a card that (1) reports the server-side folder-drop lane state
// honestly — loading first, never guessed from local input — and (2) lets an
// operator paste a URL straight into their library. Pinned here:
//   1. The card is anchored at id="folder-drop", directly below the
//      "Your business" section (id="business"), and follows its card/pill
//      conventions.
//   2. It round-trips through the folder-drop lane API (status, verify,
//      share) and the library URL-ingestion API.
//   3. The three lane-state copies are user-facing status language — they
//      must appear verbatim, not paraphrased, so a screenshot of the source
//      matches a screenshot of the UI.
//   4. The status pill derives from fetched server state with a loading
//      state first, mirroring the business-context pill's server-snapshot
//      pattern — never from anything the operator just typed.
//   5. A reader-email copy control exists because the reader address is not
//      memorable — the operator needs to paste it into Drive's sharing
//      dialog without retyping it.
//   6. A successful URL add reports the file by name; a failed one shows the
//      server's own message, not a generic fallback.
