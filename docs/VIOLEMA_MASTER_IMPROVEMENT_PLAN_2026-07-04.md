# VIOLEMA — Master Improvement Plan (Beta → Winner App → Seed 2026)

**Date:** 2026-07-04
**Prepared for:** Max (max@purpleorange.io)
**Implementer:** Claude Opus 4.8 (each work package below is written to be handed directly to Opus 4.8 as a self-contained task)
**Repo state audited:** branch `claude/build-ai-assistant-platform-BsdRr`, commit `246e768`
**Inputs:** full backend audit, full frontend audit, full product-docs review (this session). The SecondBrain vault (`/Users/maximisto/SecondBrain/...`) is not reachable from this remote container — sections flagged **[VAULT]** should be reconciled against `Violema - Dashboard.md`, `Violema - Runbook.md`, and `Violema Deployment Auth SEO Canon.md` before execution on a machine that has them.

---

## The Thesis

Violema's positioning — **"the reviewable AI operator for founder-led teams"** — is genuinely differentiated. Nobody in the category (Zapier AI, Lindy, Relay.app, n8n+AI, generic GPT wrappers) owns *inspectable autonomy*: every run reviewable, every step evidenced, every dollar of cost visible. The chat streaming surface is already near Claude/ChatGPT polish, and the credit-margin telemetry (P5) is something even funded competitors don't show users.

But the audit found the beta is a **convincing shell over a fragile core**:

1. **The product's central promise is currently false.** The 7 chat tools return fabricated demo data (`docs/INTEGRATIONS_ARCHITECTURE.md` admits "nothing real happens"). An investor demo that gets probed collapses.
2. **There is no tenant isolation.** Any beta user can read/write any other tenant's data — including their encrypted provider API keys — by setting an `X-Workspace-Id` header (`backend/src/server.ts:401-427`). Client-side `role` in localStorage is user-editable to `admin` (`frontend/src/lib/auth.ts:18-58`).
3. **The persistence layer loses data by design.** Whole-file synchronous JSON writes with no atomicity, no locking, silent reset-to-`[]` on corruption (`backend/src/platform/jsonStore.ts:6-13`).
4. **Money is not safe.** Credit accounting is check-then-act with no reservation; concurrent requests double-spend; the agent tool loop has **no iteration cap**, so a $0-balance user can trigger unbounded token spend (`server.ts:1187`, `store.ts:223-244`).
5. **Velocity is collapsing under monoliths.** `server.ts` 5,707 lines / 53 routes; `AgentStudio.tsx` 9,389 lines; `Dashboard.tsx` 6,527 lines. Tests exist but no runner is wired; zero CI; ~7 log lines in the whole server.

The plan: **make the promise true, make the core safe, then make the differentiation undeniable.** Five phases, strictly ordered by dependency. Phases 0–1 are non-negotiable before any external user or investor touches the product. Phases 2–4 are where "winner app" happens. Phase 5 packages it for the raise.

---

## Phase 0 — Stop the Bleeding (security + money safety)

*Everything here is small, surgical, and must ship before anything else. No new features. Target: 1–2 Opus sessions.*

### WP-0.1 Enforce user→workspace authorization (kills the IDOR)

**Problem:** `resolveWorkspaceContext` (`backend/src/server.ts:401-427`) trusts `X-Workspace-Id` / `?workspace_id` / `body.workspaceId` from the client. `AuthUserRecord` (`backend/src/auth.ts:13-27`) has no workspace linkage. Every settings/task/billing/automation route is exposed cross-tenant.

**Steps:**
1. Add `workspaceIds: string[]` (and `defaultWorkspaceId: string`) to `AuthUserRecord` in `backend/src/auth.ts`. On user creation (`upsertAuthUser`), mint a deterministic workspace id from the user id and store it.
2. Write a one-shot migration that assigns every existing user in `auth-users.json` their own workspace id, and maps existing data: any workspace id currently present in `platform-tasks.json` / `automations.json` / `workspace-settings.json` gets assigned to the user whose activity created it (where ambiguous, assign to the admin account and log it).
3. In the global auth middleware (`server.ts:307-336`), after token verification, attach `req.authUser`. Rewrite `resolveWorkspaceContext` to: take the client-supplied workspace id **only as a selector**, verify it is in `req.authUser.workspaceIds`, else 403. If absent, fall back to `defaultWorkspaceId`. Admin role may access any workspace (server-verified role only).
4. Scope the scheduler and Slack event handlers: `automations.json` records must carry `workspace_id` and `owner_user_id`; `executeAutomation` and all automation CRUD routes filter by the caller's workspace. (This also fixes the documented P1 "automations are global" bug from `docs/handoffs/2026-06-21-claude-handoff.md`.)
5. Slack events (`server.ts:5050`) currently hardcode `DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_ID` — map the Slack team/channel to a workspace via the stored Slack connection instead; if unmapped, drop the event with a log line.

**Acceptance:** an integration test proving user B with a valid session gets 403 reading user A's `/api/settings`, tasks, automations, and billing; `npm test` green.

### WP-0.2 Kill client-trusted role/authz on the frontend

**Problem:** `frontend/src/lib/auth.ts:18-58` stores `role` in localStorage and gates admin UI on it; `ADMIN_EMAILS` hardcoded in the client bundle (`auth.ts:20-23`).

**Steps:**
1. Treat the backend session (`GET /api/auth/session`) as the sole source of truth for `role`. Remove `ADMIN_EMAILS` and `isAdminEmail` from the client entirely (the server already has its own allowlist).
2. Keep localStorage only as a display cache (name/email for instant paint); never read `role` from it for gating. `ProtectedRoute` and `AdminDashboard` must gate on the fetched backend session.
3. Ensure every admin API route re-verifies role server-side (audit each `/api/auth/admin*` and admin dashboard route — the check must be on `req.authUser.role`, never on request body/header).

**Acceptance:** editing localStorage to `role: "admin"` produces no admin UI and no admin API access.

### WP-0.3 Cap the agent tool loop + hold credits before running

**Problem:** `while (continueLoop)` with no bound (`server.ts:1187`, `:1310`); credits checked once pre-run, debited post-run — concurrent requests double-spend; a near-zero user can burn unbounded tokens.

**Steps:**
1. Add `MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS` (default 24) and a per-request token budget to both the Anthropic and OpenAI loops. On breach: gracefully close the loop with a final "I hit the step limit for this task" message, mark the run `capped`, and charge only actual usage.
2. Implement a **credit hold**: at request start, append a `hold` ledger entry for the estimate (negative available-balance effect); at completion, replace with the actual charge and release the remainder. `canSpendCredits` computes against balance-minus-active-holds. Holds expire after 15 minutes (crash safety).
3. Wrap the `JSON.parse(result)` at `server.ts:1273` in a try/catch that emits the raw string as the tool result instead of aborting the SSE stream.
4. Add retry-with-backoff (3 attempts, 1s/4s/10s, on 429/5xx/network) to the Anthropic and OpenAI calls in `models.ts` and `server.ts`.

**Acceptance:** a test that fires 5 concurrent chat requests against a balance sufficient for 2 shows total debits never exceed balance; a mocked always-tool-calling model terminates at the cap.

### WP-0.4 Atomic file writes (bridge until Phase 1 DB)

**Steps:** In `jsonStore.ts`, write to `${path}.tmp` then `fs.renameSync` (atomic on same filesystem). On read, if parse fails, do **not** return `[]` silently — move the corrupt file to `${path}.corrupt.<ts>`, log loudly, and try `${path}.bak`; write a `.bak` copy before each successful write. Serialize writes per-file through a simple in-process promise queue keyed by path (kills same-process lost updates until the DB lands).

**Acceptance:** kill -9 during a write loop leaves a parseable store; concurrent writers through the queue never interleave.

---

## Phase 1 — Real Foundation (database, durable scheduler, CI)

*Target: 3–5 Opus sessions. This unlocks everything after it.*

### WP-1.1 Migrate persistence to SQLite (better-sqlite3, WAL mode)

**Why SQLite over Postgres now:** single-VPS deploy (PM2 + nginx, `deploy/DEPLOY.md`), zero ops overhead, synchronous transactional API that maps 1:1 onto the current call sites, real ACID, trivially backed up (single file + litestream later). Postgres is the right move at multi-node scale — design the data layer so the swap is a driver change, not a rewrite.

**Steps:**
1. Add `better-sqlite3`. Create `backend/src/db/` with: `schema.sql` (tables: `users`, `sessions`, `workspaces`, `workspace_members`, `tasks`, `task_runs`, `ledger_entries`, `credit_holds`, `automations`, `automation_runs`, `workspace_settings`, `stripe_events`, `waitlist`), `db.ts` (connection, WAL pragma, migrations runner with a `schema_migrations` table), and `repositories/` (one module per aggregate exposing the exact function signatures the JSON stores expose today — `listTasks`, `addLedgerEntry`, `upsertAuthUser`, etc.).
2. Port call sites store-by-store in this order (each its own commit, tests green between): `auth` → `ledger/billing` → `tasks/runs` → `automations` → `settings` → `stripe_events/waitlist`. The repository layer means `server.ts` barely changes.
3. `addLedgerEntry` + hold release become a single SQLite transaction with a `CHECK (balance_after >= 0)`-style guard enforced in the transaction (read current balance FOR UPDATE semantics via the write lock).
4. One-shot importer `backend/src/db/importJsonStores.ts` that ingests all existing `*.json` state files, verifies row counts, and renames the JSON files to `*.imported`. Run automatically on first boot if the DB is empty and JSON files exist.
5. Nightly backup: a cron in the scheduler that copies the SQLite file (via `VACUUM INTO`) to `backups/` with 14-day retention. **[VAULT]** reconcile backup destination with the Runbook's ops conventions.

**Acceptance:** all existing `node:test` suites pass against SQLite; importer round-trips current production JSON (copy from VPS) with zero row loss; concurrent-debit test from WP-0.3 now passes at the DB level.

### WP-1.2 Durable, idempotent scheduler

**Problem:** in-process `node-cron`, in-memory task map, re-executes past-due automations on every restart with no idempotency (`scheduler.ts:498-512`); hand-rolled `computeNextRunAt` diverges from node-cron (no ranges support).

**Steps:**
1. Replace the fire-on-boot-if-past-due logic with an `automation_runs` table keyed by `(automation_id, scheduled_for)` — a run is claimed by inserting that row (UNIQUE constraint = idempotency key). Missed windows during downtime create at most **one** catch-up run, and only if the automation opts into `catch_up: true` (default false — a founder's Monday 9am report should not fire at 2pm after a restart unless asked).
2. Replace the custom cron matcher with `cron-parser` for `next_run_at` computation so display and execution agree; keep `node-cron` for ticking or move to a simple 30s poll of `next_run_at <= now` (recommended — one mechanism, no drift, restart-safe).
3. Overlap guard: refuse to start a run while a `running` row exists for the same automation; mark runs `abandoned` if `running` for >30 min (crash recovery).
4. Persist per-step results into `automation_runs` (the frontend "Latest result" panel already renders these — extend it to a run *history* list, last 20 runs).

**Acceptance:** restart mid-run does not duplicate a delivery; two instances of the process (simulated) never double-fire; run history endpoint returns per-step records.

### WP-1.3 Wire tests + CI + deploy pipeline

**Steps:**
1. Backend: add `"test": "tsx --test tests/**/*.test.ts"` (add `tsx` dev-dep). Frontend: add vitest + `@testing-library/react`; convert the 16 hand-rolled `*.contract.ts` files to vitest suites (mechanical: replace local `assert` with `expect`).
2. GitHub Actions workflow: on PR and push — backend tsc + tests, frontend tsc + lint + vitest + vite build. Block merge on red.
3. New integration-test layer (supertest against the Express app with a temp SQLite DB): auth flows, the WP-0.1 tenancy 403s, credit hold/debit, automation CRUD + run, Stripe webhook idempotency. These are the tests that guard the money and the security fixes.
4. Deploy: extend `deploy/deploy.sh` into a GitHub Actions deploy job (SSH action) triggered by a tag or manual dispatch, so **push→live is one click and auditable**. Keep the manual script as fallback. **[VAULT]** the Runbook may already prescribe a deploy ritual — align rather than replace.

**Acceptance:** CI red blocks a deliberately broken PR; a tagged release reaches the VPS without a manual SSH session.

### WP-1.4 Observability floor

**Steps:**
1. Add `pino` structured logging with request middleware (request id, user id, workspace id, route, latency, status). Replace the ~16 `console.*` calls.
2. Add Sentry (backend + frontend) — free tier is fine for beta. Wire the Express error handler and React error boundary.
3. Per-run cost telemetry: every chat/automation run already computes tokens + credits + provider cost (P5) — log it as a structured event and add `GET /api/admin/metrics` (runs/day, tokens/day, provider spend/day, margin, active users, failure rate). This becomes the seed-round metrics tap (Phase 5).
4. `/api/health` extended: DB reachable, scheduler tick age, provider key presence — already partially there per docs; make it comprehensive.

**Acceptance:** a thrown error in a route appears in Sentry with request id; `/api/admin/metrics` returns real numbers.

### WP-1.5 Decompose `server.ts` (mechanical, after tests exist)

**Steps:** Split into routers, no behavior change, one commit per extraction, integration tests green after each: `routes/auth.ts`, `routes/chat.ts` (+ `services/agentLoop.ts` for the tool loops), `routes/automations.ts`, `routes/billing.ts`, `routes/settings.ts` (exists), `routes/slack.ts`, `routes/integrations.ts`, `routes/admin.ts`, `middleware/` (auth gate, workspace resolution, rate limits). Target: no file over 800 lines. `buildSystemPrompt` and Slack formatting helpers move to `services/`.

**Acceptance:** `server.ts` < 300 lines (app assembly only); route inventory identical (snapshot test on the Express router stack).

---

## Phase 2 — Make the Promise True (real work, real integrations)

*This is the highest product-risk item: the demo tools fabricate data. "Reviewable AI operator" only lands if the work is real. Target: 4–6 Opus sessions.*

### WP-2.1 Truth-labeling pass (ship immediately, one session)

Until real integrations land, every tool result that is fabricated must say so in the UI. Add `simulated: true` to demo tool outputs; render an unmissable "Simulated data — connect [Stripe] to see yours" chip on tool cards and delivered reports. **An investor who catches one fabricated number silently presented as real is a lost round.** This also converts demo mode into an activation funnel (chip → connect CTA).

### WP-2.2 Credential vault + integration OAuth spine

Build the `credentialVault.ts` + `/api/integrations/:provider/start|callback|disconnect` routes specified in `docs/INTEGRATIONS_ARCHITECTURE.md` (the design is already written — implement it):
1. Vault: per-workspace encrypted credentials in the new DB (AES-256-GCM already proven in `settingsStore.ts:106-129`); introduce a dedicated `CREDENTIAL_VAULT_KEY` env var with key-version column (fixes the WP: rotation-bricks-tokens weakness; keep decrypt fallback to the legacy derived key for migration).
2. Generic OAuth handler pattern (the Google/Microsoft auth flows in `server.ts:3691-3910` are the template — extract and generalize).
3. `/settings` Integrations section: connected state, scopes, disconnect, per-integration health check.

### WP-2.3 Hero integrations — make three real end-to-end

Priority order (founder-wedge value × demo impact):
1. **Stripe (read)** — real MRR/churn/failed-payments in the daily revenue monitor. The workspace already has Stripe billing code to model from.
2. **Google Workspace (Gmail read + Calendar read)** — reuses the Google OAuth client from auth; unlocks "inbox triage" and "week ahead" automations.
3. **GitHub (read)** — PRs/issues/commits for the weekly founder update. The category's founder ICP lives here.

Each: typed tool definition (input schema, output schema), vault-backed client, real fetch with retry, unit tests with recorded fixtures, and the tool card rendering real evidence links (deep links to the Stripe payment / email / PR — this *is* the "source-linked output" moat).

### WP-2.4 Composio long-tail behind a feature flag

`composioBridge.ts` exists; wire it to the vault + integrations UI for the 250+ long-tail (Notion, Linear, HubSpot...), flagged per-workspace. Hero integrations stay native (quality-controlled); long-tail rides Composio. This matches the documented Tier-1/Tier-2 architecture.

### WP-2.5 Typed automation runtime (finish P4)

The runtime is still partly "stringy" (`docs/CLAUDE_TASK_QUEUE.md` item 4). Define a versioned `AutomationSpec` (zod schema): typed steps (`research | analyze | draft | deliver`), typed sources (integration refs, not free text), typed delivery targets, typed conditions (replace the string-pattern `evaluateCondition` with a small structured condition object; keep string parsing as an import shim). Validate on save; migrate stored automations. This is what makes the template gallery (WP-4.3) and reliability possible.

---

## Phase 3 — Frontend Platform (velocity + polish)

*Target: 4–6 Opus sessions. Parallelizable with Phase 2 after 3.1.*

### WP-3.1 Data layer: TanStack Query + typed API client

1. Add `@tanstack/react-query`. Create `src/lib/api/client.ts`: one fetch wrapper (base URL, credentials, workspace header, JSON errors→typed `ApiError`, 401→session refresh→login redirect).
2. Create typed hooks per resource (`useTasks`, `useAutomations`, `useCreditSnapshot`, `useSession`, `useSettings`...) replacing the 38 raw `fetch()` sites. Query keys scoped by workspace. Mutations invalidate; automation "Save & run" becomes mutation + optimistic status.
3. Kill the redundant-fetch problem: credits fetched once, shared everywhere (Dashboard, ChatInterface, Navbar, BillingGateBar currently each refetch and can disagree).
4. Central error surface: one toast system; no more silent `catch {}` (16 sites in Dashboard alone).

### WP-3.2 Decompose Dashboard.tsx and AgentStudio.tsx

Follow the pattern that already works in `src/features/missions/` and `src/features/agent-studio/` (pure logic separated from view):
- `Dashboard.tsx` (6,527 lines, 37 useState) → `features/dashboard/`: `ChatPane`, `AutomationsPane` (+ `AutomationEditor`, `RunHistoryPanel`), `Sidebar`, `TaskPanel`, with state moving into React Query + small local state. Target: no file > 500 lines.
- `AgentStudio.tsx` (9,389 lines) → finish the started decomposition into its existing `features/agent-studio/` rooms; per product docs, **hide Agent Studio from non-admin users** behind a flag (the docs already call for this — it confuses the founder-wedge story).
- Bundle win is automatic: per-pane chunks replace one 936KB monolith chunk.

### WP-3.3 Replace the regex markdown renderer

Swap the 200-line hand-rolled `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` renderer (`ChatInterface.tsx:41-237`) for `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` + `rehype-sanitize`, with custom renderers that preserve the existing styled components (tables in `overflow-x-auto`, code blocks with copy button). The chat is the surface investors stare at; GFM tables and nested lists must not fall apart. Keep the streaming-cursor behavior.

### WP-3.4 Design-system primitives

Promote the `.ui-*` CSS conventions into React primitives: `<Button>`, `<Card>`, `<Pill>`, `<Modal>` (with `role="dialog"`, focus trap, Escape — fixes the artifact-preview a11y gap at `ChatInterface.tsx:557-630`), `<Input>`, `<EmptyState>`, `<Skeleton>`. Adopt in decomposed panes as they're extracted (not a big-bang restyle). Add `aria-expanded` to disclosure buttons (ThinkingBlock, ToolCallBlock).

### WP-3.5 Mobile pass

Dashboard has ~38 breakpoint utilities across 6.5K lines — effectively desktop-only. After decomposition: sidebar as drawer (compact footer already done), chat full-bleed, automation editor as full-screen sheet, tables→cards on `sm`. Acceptance: core loop (read chat, review a run, approve) fully usable at 390px width. Founders check their AI operator from phones — this is a retention feature, not chrome.

---

## Phase 4 — Winner-App Differentiation

*The category-beating features. All depend on Phases 1–3. Target: 5–8 Opus sessions.*

### WP-4.1 The Run Review surface (the moat, part 1)

Nobody in the category has a first-class "review what the AI did" experience. Build it:
- Every run (chat task or automation) gets a permanent **Run page**: timeline of steps, each with inputs, outputs, evidence links (real integration deep-links from WP-2.3), tokens, credits, provider cost, duration.
- **Review gates:** automations can require approval before the deliver step; approval requests land in Slack (button) and the web Reviews queue. Approve/reject/edit-then-approve.
- Diff view for recurring reports: "what changed since last week's investor update" — trivially valuable to the founder ICP and screenshot-bait for marketing.

### WP-4.2 Cost intelligence (the moat, part 2)

The P5 margin plumbing exists — turn it into a user-facing killer feature: per-automation monthly cost projection ("this daily monitor ≈ 340 credits/mo"), budget caps per automation with auto-pause + Slack alert, and a workspace cost dashboard (spend by automation, by model tier, trend). Position: "the only AI operator that shows you exactly what every task costs before and after it runs." **[VAULT]** reconcile pricing narrative with the canon doc — the $29/$50/$149 plan-doc numbers contradict the coded $79/2000-credit economics; pick one, fix `cost.ts` + `/plans` + landing copy together (see WP-5.2).

### WP-4.3 Template gallery → 5-minute activation

Six documented templates (weekly investor update, daily revenue monitor, competitor brief...) become one-click installs on the typed runtime (WP-2.5): pick template → connect the 1–2 required integrations (WP-2.2 flow) → "run once now" (Save & run already shipped) → review output → schedule. Instrument every funnel step. Public `/templates/<slug>` SEO pages render the same specs (already in the task queue). **Activation-to-first-reviewed-run is THE seed-deck metric.**

### WP-4.4 Slack as a full operating surface

The bot works; finish the loop: approval buttons (WP-4.1) in Slack, `/violema run <automation>`, run-completion digests with evidence links, and per-workspace Slack mapping (from WP-0.1 step 5). Founder never has to leave Slack for the daily loop; the web app is the control room.

### WP-4.5 Streaming + resilience polish

SSE reconnect with `Last-Event-ID` resume on the chat stream; automation runs stream step progress live to the run page; graceful "model provider degraded, retrying" states (retries from WP-0.3). The product should feel *calmly reliable* — that texture is what separates winner apps from demos.

---

## Phase 5 — Investor Readiness (2026 seed)

*Target: 2–3 Opus sessions + founder work.*

### WP-5.1 The metrics tap
From WP-1.4 telemetry, build the internal one-pager investors will ask for: WAU, activation rate (signup → first reviewed run), retained automations/week (recurring-value proxy), runs/week growth, gross margin per run (real, from P5 data), failure rate trend. Auto-emailed weekly to Max.

### WP-5.2 Pricing + narrative coherence
Fix the pricing contradiction (plan doc vs `cost.ts` vs blank `/pricing` route — real route is `/plans`; add a redirect). Landing copy audit against what is now *actually real* post-Phase 2 — the docs themselves flag the current copy as over-broad ("AI coworker that does everything" → "the reviewable AI operator for founder-led teams" wedge). Ship the SEO comparison pages from the campaign doc ("Zapier AI vs AI operator", "n8n vs AI agent") once the claims are true.

### WP-5.3 The demo path
A scripted, seeded, unbreakable demo workspace: investor update template installed, real (own-company) Stripe+GitHub connected, run history showing weeks of reviewed runs with costs, one live "run now" that completes in <60s. Rehearsable, resettable via one script.

### WP-5.4 Security posture doc
After Phases 0–1: one-page security overview (tenant isolation, AES-256-GCM vault with key versioning, hashed sessions, signature-verified webhooks, rate limits, backups, Sentry). Seed-stage diligence increasingly asks; having it ready signals operator maturity.

---

## Sequencing & Dependency Map

```
Phase 0 (WP-0.1 → 0.4)            [BLOCKS EVERYTHING — security + money]
   └─ Phase 1 (1.1 DB → 1.2 scheduler → 1.3 CI → 1.4 obs → 1.5 split)
        ├─ Phase 2 (2.1 truth-label FIRST → 2.2 vault → 2.3 heroes → 2.4 composio → 2.5 typed runtime)
        ├─ Phase 3 (3.1 data layer → 3.2 decompose → 3.3 markdown ∥ 3.4 primitives → 3.5 mobile)
        └────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                 └─ Phase 4 (4.1 review surface → 4.2 cost intel → 4.3 templates → 4.4 slack → 4.5 polish)
                      └─ Phase 5 (5.1 metrics → 5.2 pricing/copy → 5.3 demo → 5.4 security doc)
```

Notes:
- **WP-2.1 (truth-labeling) jumps the queue** — it's a half-day and removes the single biggest demo landmine.
- Phases 2 and 3 parallelize across sessions once Phase 1 lands.
- Already-shipped work this plan builds on (don't redo): P5 cost plumbing, Save & run, per-step results panel, fail-closed conditions, compact sidebar, Settings account section, OAuth code paths (need only env vars + the WP-0 hardening).

## Open items requiring Max (not Opus)

1. **Env vars on VPS** — Google/Microsoft OAuth client creds, `AUTH_STATE_SECRET`, `CREDENTIAL_VAULT_KEY` (new, WP-2.2), Composio key. Opus can't mint these.
2. **Pricing decision** (WP-5.2 / 4.2): $79/2000-credit economics vs the $29/$50/$149 plan-doc tiers — pick before landing copy work.
3. **[VAULT] reconciliation** — run this plan past `Violema - Dashboard.md`, `Violema - Runbook.md`, and the Deployment/Auth/SEO canon on a machine with vault access; anything the canon contradicts, the canon wins and this doc gets amended.
4. **Beta cohort** — Phases 0–1 done = safe to onboard the 3–5 friendly founders the beta-readiness audit calls for; their reviewed-run data feeds the Phase 5 metrics.
